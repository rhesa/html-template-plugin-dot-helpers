NAME
    HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot::Helpers - Add useful objects to your
    templates

VERSION
    Version 0.01

SYNOPSIS
      use HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot::Helpers;

    Then in your template, you can do:

      <tmpl_var Number.format_currency(orderitem.price)>
  
DESCRIPTION
    This helper class adds some useful objects to your Dot-enabled templates
    (see HTML::Template::Plugin::Dot).

  Added objects
    Number
        An extended Number::Format object. See Number::Format for
        documentation. Note that only the object oriented methods are
        supported here.

        I've added several generic numerical methods. Most (well, all in
        this release) are boolean methods, useful in "<tmpl_if>s". They are:

        equals - test whether two numbers are equal (==)
        le, lt, ge, gt - test how two numbers compare
                (implemented with <=, <, >=, > respectively)

        The following is not yet implemented.

    String
        Adds generic string testing functions similar to the above:

        equals - test whether two strings are equal (eq)
        le, lt, ge, gt - test how two strings compare lexically
